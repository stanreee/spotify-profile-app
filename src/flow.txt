in App.js, check if token exists (was exported in another file)

if not, send to login page
if it does exist, send to dashboard



TOKEN  HANDLING

when token is received and given to backend of app, send it to the frontend and
store it in local storage

when making requests, send token to backend of app, then have backend make
requests to the spotify api given the token, then send the data received
from spotify to frontend

    right before making requests, check to see if the token is expired (with
    time stamps), if it is expired, refresh the token
